<h1>Back to Sleep - Health Canada SIDS Social Marketing Campaign</h1>
<p>Using carefully targeted mass media messaging strategies, <em>Back to Sleep</em> taught parents and other primary infant caregivers across Canada how to avoid the risk factors associated with Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).</p><!-- Header already contains P tags.-->
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) refers to the sudden and unexpected death of an apparently healthy infant that remains unexplained even after a full investigation. In Canada, SIDS is the leading cause of death for infants over four weeks old, accounting for about one infant death out of every 1,400 live births. Although there has been a recent decrease in reported cases of SIDS in Canada, it remains a significant public health concern.</p>
<p>In 1998, new research indicated that to reduce the risk of SIDS an infant should be placed to sleep on his or her back. These findings updated existing information that suggested that the back or side sleeping position were safest. To reflect this new finding, Health Canadas existing social marketing strategy was re-tooled, revitalized and re-launched under the banner Back to Sleep, with a corporate partner to bolster its impact.</p><!-- Background already contains P tags.-->
<h2>Setting Objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Overall Objective:</strong></p>
<p>To reduce the risk of SIDS by 10% in Canada over the five-year period from 2000 to 2004.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>The objectives for the Back to Sleep campaign were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase awareness/knowledge of the risks of SIDS in Canada over a five-year period.</li>
<li>Increase awareness/knowledge of the things that parents can do to reduce the risk of SIDS (over five-year period).</li>
<li>Reduce the risk of SIDS by 10% in Canada over a five-year period.</li>
</ul><!-- Objectives already contains P tags.-->
<h2>Getting Informed</h2>
<p>Past research has shown that parents and other caregivers have a strong propensity to adopt behaviours that are demonstrated to be in the best interests of their infants. As explained below, this information was used to determine the primary target audience for <em>Back to Sleep</em> (parents and other caregivers), as well as to develop the campaign strategy (mass media-based, awareness raising.)</p>
<p>Prior to the launch of the campaign in 2000, Health Canada had already conducted an awareness and attitude survey of 600 respondents. Based on that survey, it established benchmarks from which to evaluate the impact of the <em>Back to Sleep</em> campaign, as well as print templates for the campaign. The templates were brought to focus groups in three cities, for testing and input.</p><!-- Informed already contains P tags.-->
<h2>Delivering the Program</h2>
<p>An awareness-raising mass-media strategy (<a href="/en/tools-of-change/mass-media/">Mass Media</a>) was adopted because the barriers to behaviour change were low, relative to the motivation to participate (i.e. risk of babys death). The campaign, called Back to Sleep, was targeted primarily at mothers, expectant/new mothers, partners and peers aged 20 to 34, grandparents, and other caregivers. Certain campaign components also reached outside the home to target a secondary audience - people directly involved in the provision of infant health care and the dissemination infant health care information (i.e. public health units, hospitals, physicians, and pre- and post-natal educators).</p>
<p>Each media component was developed by Health Canada in conjunction with three NGO partners (The Canadian Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths (CFSID), The Canadian Institute for Child Health (CICH), and The Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS)).</p>
<p>The Canadian Paediatric Society is a national advocacy group, which helped to add credibility to the campaigns communications. All of the materials provided clear, consistent messages about reducing the risk of SIDS, and emphasized the four precautions associated with SIDS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Back sleeping position</li>
<li>Avoid second-hand smoke</li>
<li>Avoid over-bundling the baby</li>
<li>Breastfeeding can help protect against SIDS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation of the strategy also involved the use of the following media-backed message delivery tactics.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Media Tactics Used:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style: none none outside"><strong>1. Joint Statement</strong> - <em>Reducing the Risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in Canada</em> <br/>
    Four partners (Health Canada, The Canadian Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths, The Canadian Institute for Child Health, and the Canadian Paediatric Society), in consultation with key stakeholders, developed a national statement on reducing the risk of SIDS, in both English and French. The objective of this statement was to provide health professionals with clear, consistent messages on this important issue.</li>
<li style="list-style: none none outside">
<p><strong>2. Back to Sleep Brochure and Back to Sleep Poster</strong> <br/>
    The poster was packaged with selected Canadian parenting magazines that were bulk shipped directly to healthcare professionals, and to pre- and post-birth newsletters targeted at health professionals. The posters were also displayed in the washrooms at all 176 McDonalds restaurants in Quebec.</p>
</li>
<li style="list-style: none none outside">
<p><strong>3. Back to Sleep Promotional ad</strong> <br/>
    The one-page ad was included in a variety of magazines, including Today's Parents and Expecting. The magazines in which the ad appeared, were selected based on their reach and fit (the majority were given out free at doctor's offices/ public health units, reaching lower socio-economic segments of the population).</p>
</li>
<li style="list-style: none none outside">
<p><strong>4. Back to Sleep Television Public Service Announcement</strong> <br/>
    A 30-second PSA, describing the four precautions parents can take, was sent out to broadcasters across Canada. This was essential in targeting at-risk parents with lower literacy levels, who might have had trouble reading print materials.</p>
</li>
<li style="list-style: none none outside">
<p><strong>5. Partnership with Procter and Gamble (Pampers)</strong> <br/>
    Procter &amp; Gambles Pampers division included the key Back to Sleep message on their two smallest sized diapers in English, French, and Spanish. They also created a promotional door-hanger, distributed the existing educational pamphlet to new mothers through the majority of hospitals in Canada, and promoted SIDS awareness through their own advertising campaigns.</p>
</li>
<li style="list-style: none none outside">
<p><strong>6. Partnership with The Canadian Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths</strong> <br/>
    CFSID promoted the campaign through Babys Breath, a newsletter developed by CFSID that is distributed to people wishing to gain information about SIDS. CFSID included copies of the Back to Sleep promotional material with the distribution of the newsletter.</p>
</li>
</ol><!-- Delivering already contains P tags.-->
<h2>Measuring Achievements</h2>
<p>A post-campaign tracking survey (replicating the pre-campaign benchmark survey) was conducted in the spring of 2001, to test awareness and attitude shifts and to suggest any necessary modifications to the campaign. The survey involved 605 respondents.</p><!-- Results_B already contains P tags.-->
