<h3>What is this Tool?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Activities introduced at school that students can do at home and that specifically     involve other members of their families.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Would You Use It?</h3>
<p>School children are often more receptive to learning new ways of doing things than their parents. They can serve as powerful agents of change in reaching other members of their families. Furthermore, promotional programs in schools offer some particular advantages: for example, you may be able to assign activities, data collection, and analysis to students as home or class work; it may be easier to find ways of increasing the visibility of participation and making use of norm appeals; and it may also be relatively easy to provide individual and group feedback.</p>
<p><a href="#notes">Note for health promoters.</a></p>
<h3>When Would You Use It?</h3>
<p>Use school place promotional programs in any of the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>when the activities you are promoting relate to the curriculum being taught</li>
<li>when the activities begin, continue or end at school (e.g., lunch food routines,     commuting practices)</li>
<li>when the desired actions can be done both at school and at home (e.g., composting and     recycling)</li>
</ul>

<div class="plan_col_left">
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Lack of family support arising from safety concerns was found to be the major barrier to children riding to and from school. Lochside School's <a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/3">Bike Smarts</a> program therefore focused on bicycle safety, kept parents informed, and encouraged them to participate and see the skills their children were acquiring.</p><p>To help parents comply with their litterless lunch program, <a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/16">Norway</a> Public School sold subsidized reusable lunch bags containing reusable food containers.</p><p> <a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/97">Greenest City</a> found that child safety issues were a key barrier to getting children to walk and cycle to school, due to an increase in traffic injuries and fatalities as well as threats of bullying, harassment and abduction. Their program focused on ways of addressing these safety issues.</p> </div>

<p><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/3">Bike Smarts</a> provided in-class instruction on riding safety. To complete the program, the students were required to pass both a written test and an "on-bike" cycling skills test.</p><p> <a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/97">Greenest City</a>s Blazing Trails Through the Urban Jungle was a classroom mapping activity that complemented the Ontario school board curriculum in social studies, mathematics, and science. By mapping street names, landmarks, and safe places, for example, children felt safer and more confident traveling in their community.</p> <p> <a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/145">Auto$mart</a> implemented a Student Driver Program to teach energy-efficient driving habits to novice drivers through existing driver education programs. Most of the habits being promoted also contributed to safer driving, so the messages were consistent with existing driver education curriculums.</p> <a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/176/">Working Towards Peace </a>

<p><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/13">In Concert with the Environment</a> coached each student on drawing up a plan of action with his or her household to save energy at home.

To participate actively, the parents needed to read a recycling flyer from the local public works department.</p>
<p>The students at <a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/25">Whitney Public School</a> took over their homes' recycling activities for a week. This enabled them to see where improvements could be made by the household and encouraged them to promote these changes in their homes.</p><p> <a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/97">Greenest City</a>s active transportation program required participation by a sufficient number of families in participating communities.</p> </div>
