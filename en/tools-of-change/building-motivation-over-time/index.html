<h3>What is this Tool?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Motivational techniques such as linking to activities that people are already doing, recognizing them for actions already taken, and providing ongoing opportunities to take further steps and become more involved.</li>
<li>Steps for strengthening motivation over time.</li>
<li>A key element of <a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/social-learning-theory" target="_blank">social learning</a> theory.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Would You Use It?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Because you want to increase the likelihood that a person will start and continue the activities you are promoting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When Would You Use It?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Before designing your program, identify the most relevant motivators. Then structure the following techniques into your program. Each technique has its own right timing, as described below.</li>
<li>The main example used is the home visit service of ReCAP, initiated in 1993 as part of Ontario''s Green Communities.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Examples</h1>
<p> <a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/20"></a><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/20">ReCAP</a> staff received the standard Green Communities training program which identified the common motivators relevant to the actions they were promoting. For example, they learned that cost and comfort were two of the key motivators influencing people to undertake home energy audits.</p> <p> <a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/114">Green$aver</a> found that the two main motivators for requesting a home energy audit were comfort and cost savings.</p> <p> <a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/119">HEADSTART</a>s public participation workshops began by asking participants to identify the transport issues most important to them. This information was tracked in two ways: (1) by total number of participants mentioning each issue (across all workshops), and (2) by the number of workshops at which each issue had been mentioned.</p> <p><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/675">COAST</a> found that among its target audience, "peace of mind" was the primary motivator for getting tested for Chlamydia.</p>
<p class="tip_example"><strong>Tip:</strong> Like barriers, motivators can be quite specific to a given action and to a given target audience.</p>

<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>	One year, <a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/5">The Clean Air Commute</a> used an ASFX E8 license plate as a backdrop for its press conference, to highlight the link to air quality.</p> <p> <a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/20">ReCAP</a>'s home advisors listened carefully to each house holder's remarks, both during the initial interview and throughout the home visit, then talked in terms of the activities (e.g., gardening) and interests (e.g., child safety) that seemed most important in each case. As part of the standard Green Communities training program, the home advisors were provided with instructions and practice exercises in doing this.</p> <p>Two different signs were used at <a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/35">Marley Station Mall</a> to encourage shoppers to take the stairs. One featured a caricature of a heart at the top of a flight of stairs and the statement "Your heart needs exercise, use the stairs." The other featured a caricature of a woman at the top of a flight of stairs with a thin waistline, wearing pants that had become too large. The caption on the sign read, "Improve your waistline, use the stairs."</p><p>	The first 40 minutes of the <a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/36">Roach Coach</a> workshops consisted of a slide show, and the last 20 minutes consisted of demonstrations and a question and answer period. The slides were specifically chosen to relate to common motivators that had been identified.</p>
<p class="tip_example"><strong>Tip:</strong> With face-to-face approaches you can look for clues and ask questions that identify the most important motivators for each person you contact. Train your program implementers to do this.</p>

Think for a moment about all the heat that would escape from a hole that size. That's why I recommend you install weather-stripping. And your attic totally lacks insulation.
