<h2><a name="1">A Brief Review of Social Marketing</a></h2>
<p><em>The following introduction to social marketing was originally excerpted from Health Canada's Social Marketing Web site </em><em>and from an article written by Eric Young of E.Y.E.</em></p>
<p>Social Marketing is a planned process for influencing change. Social Marketing is a modified term of conventional Product and Service Marketing. With its components of marketing and consumer research, advertising and promotion (including positioning, segmentation, creative strategy, message design and testing, media strategy and planning, and effective tracking), Social Marketing can play a central role in topics like health, environment, and other important issues.</p>
<p>In its most general sense, Social Marketing is a new way of thinking about some very old human endeavours. As long as there have been social systems, there have been attempts to inform, persuade, influence, motivate, to gain acceptance for new adherents to certain sets of ideas, to promote causes and to win over particular groups, to reinforce behaviour or to change it -- whether by favour, argument or force. Social Marketing has deep roots in religion, in politics, in education, and even, to a degree, in military strategy. It also has intellectual roots in disciplines such as psychology, sociology, political science, communication theory and anthropology. Its practical roots stem from disciplines such as advertising, public relations and market research, as well as to the work and experience of social activists, advocacy groups and community organizers.</p>
<p>As Phil Kotler points out in his book <i>Social Marketing - Strategies for Changing Public Behaviour, </i>campaigns for social change are not a new phenomenon. They have been waged from time immemorial. In Ancient Greece and Rome, campaigns were launched to free slaves. In England during the Industrial Revolution, campaigns were mounted to abolish debtor prisons, grant voting rights to women, and to do away with child labour. Notable social reform campaigns in nineteenth-century America included the abolition, temperance, prohibition and suffragette movements, as well as a consumer movement to have governments regulate the quality of foods and drugs.</p>
<p>In recent times, campaigns have been launched in areas such as health promotion (e.g., anti-smoking, safety, drug abuse, drinking and driving, AIDS, nutrition, physical fitness, immunization, breast cancer screening, mental health, breast feeding, family planning), environment (e.g., safer water, clean air, energy conservation, preservation of national parks and forests), education (e.g., literacy, stay in school ), economy (e.g., boost job skills and training, attract investors, revitalize older cities), and other issues like family violence, human rights, and racism.</p>
<p>Social Marketing combines the best elements of the traditional approaches to social change in an integrated planning and action framework, and utilizes advances in communication technology and marketing skills. It uses marketing techniques to generate discussion and promote information, attitudes, values and behaviours. By doing so, it helps to create a climate conducive to social and behavioral change.</p>

<h4><a name="2-2">This Site and Situational Analysis</a></h4>
<p>Situational analysis is the process of determining the real "market opportunities" for influencing change. The Planning Guide (<a href="../../../en/planning-guide/getting-informed/">Getting Informed</a> section) outlines the primary information required to conduct such an analysis, and can be used to summarize your key findings. When you choose to print your plan, this information will be consolidated into the situational analysis section of the plan.</p>
<h4><a name="2-3">This Site and Marketing Integration - the Four P's</a></h4>
<p>Marketing Integration involves making strategic decisions (and subsequent allocations of resources and effort) regarding marketing's traditional four P's:</p>
<div class="intro_cols">
<div class="intro_left">
<p>Price</p>
</div>
<div class="intro_right">
<p>This is the price paid by the consumer to adopt or "buy" the goods, services, ideas, or actions you are promoting. The price can be "paid" in money, time, risk, inconvenience, or other lifestyle changes. The main areas of this site discussing price are:</p>

<p>Place</p>
</div>
<div class="intro_right">
<p>Place is where and when the target market will perform the desired behavior, access our products and services, and become engaged in our programs. In his most recent book on social marketing, Kotler clarifies that "Our objective as we develop the place strategy is to make it as convenient and pleasant as possible for our target audience. Cost-efficient means should be explored to make locations closer and more appealing: extend hours, be there at the point of decision making, and make performing the desired behavior more convenient than the competing behavior".</p>
<p>The main areas of this site discussing how to do this are:</p>
<p><strong>Planning Guide</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../en/planning-guide/getting-informed/">Getting Informed</a> (where we discuss how to determine the points of decision making, and what could make the desired behaviour / product / service and how it is performed or accessed - more convenient and pleasant for the target market.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../en/planning-guide/targeting-audience/">Targeting the Audience</a> (where considerations of "place" are used to focus on particular groups of people, such as those who are at the right points of decision making and/or those most likely to perceive the desired behaviour /product / service  and how it is performed or accessed - as convenient and pleasant.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../en/planning-guide/choosing-tools/">Choosing Tools of Change</a> (where considerations of "place" are used to help link to activities that people are already doing, provide effective prompts, and build motivation over time.)</li>

<h4><a name="2-4">This Site and Exchange Theory</a></h4>
<p>The basic idea behind Exchange Theory is that your audience must pay a <a href="#Price">price</a> in order to "buy" or adopt the goods, services, ideas, or actions (<a href="#Product">product</a>) you are promoting. In order to persuade people to take part in the exchange, they must believe that the resulting benefits are worth the price.</p>
<p>This site can help you make the exchange more attractive in two ways.</p>
<h5>Increasing the perceived benefits by:</h5>

<h4><a name="2-5">This Site and Maintaining a Consumer Orientation </a></h4>
<p>Social Marketers focus tightly and continuously on their target audience or consumers. This emphasis on the consumer is social marketing's greatest asset and the most significant contribution it can bring to any program. All too often, program organizers are so focused on the changes they want to achieve and the messages they want to convey, that insufficient emphasis is placed on understanding and effectively reaching the people they are trying to influence.</p>
