<h3>Latest News</h3>
<h6>January 9, 2024  |  Five New <em>Landmark</em> Case Studies, Two Runners-Up, and 33 Topic Resources Added this Past Year</h6>
Our newest <em>Landmark</em> peer review and selection panel, which focuses on climate change mitigation and adaptation behaviors, has awarded <em>Landmark</em> designation to two new case studies this year. (1) <a href="https://www.toolsofchange.com/en/case-studies/detail/761">Coolfood</a> provides the food service industry with the tools and expertise to reduce emissions by 25% by 2030. (2) <a href="https://www.toolsofchange.com/en/case-studies/detail/760">Liftshare</a> is a social enterprise that has worked with over 700 of the UK's largest employers to reduce the number of single occupancy vehicle trips using carsharing, active transportation and public transit when commuting for work. Our climate panel also selected two runners-up that work to reduce food waste: <a href="https://toolsofchange.com/en/case-studies/detail/764">Fridge Night / Use Up Day</a> and <a href="https://toolsofchange.com/en/case-studies/detail/763">Flashfood</a>. In addition, our sustainable transportation and building energy panels designated three additional <em>Landmark</em> case studies related to climate change mitigation: (3) <a href="https://toolsofchange.com/en/case-studies/detail/765">Carpooling Promotion in Paris</a>, (4) <a href="https://toolsofchange.com/en/case-studies/detail/762" target="_blank">Co-Ownership of Wind Farms</a>, and  (5) <a href="https://toolsofchange.com/en/case-studies/detail/754" target="_self">Smart Trips Austin</a>. <em>Landmark</em> designation recognizes behavior change approaches and programs considered to be among the most successful, innovative, replicable and adaptable in the world. The case studies are summarized at the top of the left-hand column below. We've also added 33 new Topic Resources over the past year related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Their summaries are provided in the right hand column below.</div>

<p>Fairfax County established Transportation Demand Management (TDM) requirements (“proffers”) for new development that would have significant traffic impacts. For buildings within the urban centre of Tysons, trips had to be reduced between 25% and 65% during peak hours, depending on the size of the building and its proximity to the Metrorail stations. The county proffers required large new properties to annually monitor trips, conduct tenant commuting surveys, and show that they were meeting their trip reduction goals. They also had to conduct surveys every three years. Over seven years, 13 such developments generated 63% fewer trips, which was 34% beyond their goals. For the office buildings, this was likely at least partly a result of more people working from home during the COVID pandemic.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/766">Read More »</a></strong>

<p><em>Smart Trips Austin </em>encourages residents of Austin Texas, USA to take multi-modal transportation options (walk, bike, ride transit, and share rides) more often, rather than drive alone. The program focuses on personal interactions — educating individuals on their options and overcoming barriers to multi-modal travel. <em>Smart Trips </em>reinforces this new information using community-based programs such as learn-to-ride classes, transit instruction, and group walking activities. Initially, the program targeted residential neighbourhoods of Austin Texas; each year a different area was targeted. In 2020 the program expanded to city-wide and began to segment using a Stages of Change approach.  In 2021, it started targeting residents who had recently moved to or around Austin. <em>Smart Trips Austin</em> averaged a participation rate of 5-10% of households contacted, a 5-10% reduction in drive-alone trips among participants (about 41,000 vehicle trips per year), and a corresponding 5-10% increase in active and shared trips. This account of the program was designated a <em>Landmark</em> case study in 2023, making the City of Austin one of the few governments with more than one program designation. </p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/754">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>The Fridge Night programme offers simple, practical solutions to help people be more resourceful with and enjoy eating the food they have at home, thereby reducing food waste and associated greenhouse gas emissions. Participants pledge to use up expiring perishables one evening a week for a month, and complete weekly challenges. They are sent reminders and tips.

<p>According to Second Harvest, almost 60% (35.5 million metric tonnes) of food produced in Canada is wasted annually. Roughly 32% (1.2 million tonnes) is still edible. The app informs users about local food nearing its best before date, often discounted by 50% or more. While some items may only be usable for a day or two, others can last for weeks – especially if frozen or cooked. The Flashfood app enables food stores to sell food that would otherwise be thrown out, while reducing their carbon footprint.  Consumers are able buy food that they would otherwise deem too expensive.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/763">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>As climate change leads to more drought situations, it will be important to understand how to best promote water conservation. Southern Nevada Water Authority’s Water Smart Landscapes (WSL) program pays homeowners to replace their non-native, ornamental lawns with plants and landscapes that use less water because they are better adapted to their dry climate. It is one of the longest running “cash for grass” policies.

<p>What makes a great cycling city?  How did the medium-sized City of Copenhagen get its citizens to cycle to work / school 49% of the time? While topography and climate are significant influencers, safety, supportive infrastructure, and promotion also played key roles. Copenhagen increased cycling by making it safer, easier, and more convenient. This case illustrates the power of piloting alternative enhancements on an ongoing basis to further reduce barriers and increase benefits, based on regular surveys, traffic data and safety data. It also features a transparent planning process - the Bicycle Account – a research, evaluation, promotion, and citizen engagement tool used every two years since 1996.

<p>Paris is an inspiration for large cities around the world, having reduced car traffic in its core (Ile de France) from a mode share of 12.8% in 2010 to 6% in 2020.  How did Paris get to be one of the cities in the world with the lowest mode share for single occupant vehicles? The city is comparatively dense and has one of the top subways in the world. But what is most striking about its transformation is the increase in cycling and walking during this period – they increased from 55.4% in 2010 to 68% in 2020. Numerous programs offered by three levels of government explicitly prioritized bicycles over cars and reduced on-street car parking to make room for bike lanes. They taxed and restricted more polluting vehicles, and gradually phased them out, while providing a conversion bonus for the purchase or lease of electric-assisted bicycles and cargo bikes. In addition, car ads had to include messages promoting greener methods of transportation, and incentives were provided for bike repairs and tune-ups.

<p>While many people in Germany say they would use green energy if presented with a choice, very few consumers do so. In contrast, most people have been using green energy in a few German municipalities where citizens have had to opt out for non-renewable energy supplies rather than having to opt-in to get renewable ones. This case study also illustrates the connection between green power choices and clean air / environmental health, and the value of randomized control trials (RCTs) for measuring program impacts.

<p>About 75% of food waste goes to landfill, where it becomes one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions at 10% of total emissions. Too Good to Go turns food waste into a win-win situation for everyone, by creating jobs, generating revenue, reducing food waste, and diminishing environmental impacts. At its most basic, the app is a marketplace for surplus food. It enables you to see what extra food is likely to be available that day from nearby bakeries, stores, and restaurants - fresh food that would otherwise be thrown out at the end of the day because it would no longer be considered fresh and salable. Using the app, you can buy a ‘magic bag’ meal for roughly one third of what you would normally pay, then pick it up at the vendor’s closing time. As of June 2022, a total of 141 million bags had been sold, eliminating 775 million lb. (about 387,500 US tons) of CO2 emissions. In the first six months of 2022 alone, 88.5 million bags were sold, eliminating the equivalent of 973.5 million pounds (about 486,800 US tons) of CO2 emissions per year. </p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/758">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>This research argues that regarding laundry habits, we should treat lower emissions as a beneficial by-product rather than the main objective. We should focus on behaviors that create a need to wash rather than those involved with washing clothes. In other words, promote using clothes more often between washes by desensitizing feelings of disgust.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/397">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>Effectively reducing climate change requires marked, global behavior change. However, it is unclear which strategies are most likely to motivate people to change their climate beliefs and behaviors. This study tested 11 expert-crowdsourced interventions on four climate mitigation outcomes: beliefs, policy support, information sharing intention, and an effortful tree-planting behavioral task.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/392">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>To tackle the problem of food waste in restaurants, a nudge intervention was developed to increase the use of "doggy bags" in a restaurant close to Milan, Italy. In the intervention the default was to automatically provide a doggy bag to customers who had uneaten food on their plates, unless they actively chose to opt out. The number of doggy bags more than doubled.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/394">Read More »</a></strong>
