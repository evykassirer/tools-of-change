The Home Energy Score<sup><span lang="EN-CA" style='font-size: 8pt; font-family: "Minion Pro", serif;'>TM</span></sup> was developed to provide homeowners, buyers and renters with credible and directly comparable details about a home’s energy consumption. The ultimate goal was for homeowners to implement energy efficiency renovations. During the six months between July and December 2023, 464 participating households carried out home upgrades that saved 840,974 kWh per year, or 1,812 kWh per home per year. They undertook energy efficiency upgrades eleven times as often as non-participating households, and they claimed an upgrade incentive twelve times as often. An increase in consumer knowledge about energy efficiency, provided through assessor interaction and scorecard information, was a leading factor in the increase in upgrades.

<p>Chicago was the first U.S. city to require building owners to prominently post a building’s energy performance rating, and to share that that rating with potential buyers and/or renters. While the rating system was being introduced, ComEd and Peoples Gas ran extensive complementary incentive and rebate programs that enabled building owners and managers to make energy improvements at little to no cost. From 2017 to 2020, this program saved 7,293.6 million Btu (2.1 million kwh) per year.

<p>This campaign focused on hot water heaters that provide water on demand for heating a home and also for cooking and cleaning. Lowering the water flow temperature from 80°C to 60°C could save a 9% reduction in total gas use, but only one in ten households had adjusted their water flow temperature in the previous year. Nesta developed and pilot tested an online tool to help occupants lower their own water flow temperatures. </p>
<p>In 2022 and 2023, over 214,000 people used the online tool and indicated that they had turned down their water flow temperatures. Based on Nesta’s research, that would save around 200,304,000 kWh and £20 million on energy bills and would avoid the release of 37,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. The campaign created £33 of savings for every £1 spent on marketing.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/767">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>This innovative social marketing approach changed the energy use behaviours of low-income renters in Brisbane, Australia, through meaningful gamification. The gamified experience promoted desired behaviours and reduced undesired ones, all carefully chosen using McKenzie-Mohr's cbsm guidelines for selecting behaviors. The Reduce Your Juice program was designed to be fun, easy and impactful. On the exterior, it appears as a simple, fun and easy experience of games and gamified activities, communications, community, and rewards. However, below the surface lies a sophisticated intervention developed through the application of formative research and theory and implemented by a team of multi-disciplinary experts from the energy, social marketing, behaviour change, digital insights &amp; technology, research, and social sectors.

<p>While many people in Germany say they would use green energy if presented with a choice, very few consumers do so. In contrast, most people have been using green energy in a few German municipalities where citizens have had to opt out for non-renewable energy supplies rather than having to opt-in to get renewable ones. This case study also illustrates the connection between green power choices and clean air / environmental health, and the value of randomized control trials (RCTs) for measuring program impacts.

<p>Solarize is a group purchase program designed to simplify and reduce the cost of investing in solar energy. The campaign organizes a volunteer committee of residents to competitively select a solar installer who agrees to set pricing. At a series of free educational workshops participants can learn about the technology, incentives, and financing options. Interested, participants can then sign up for a free site assessment and are guaranteed the Solarize price, if they sign a contract within the campaign timeline. Customers can save as much as 25% of the total cost of installation. This approach enables grassroot and other solar advocates to build motivation and engagement over time, reduce key barriers to action, convert “interest” into “action”, and permanently transform the market for solar installations in their communities. Resulting installations generated 62,000,000 kWh of clean energy supply each year.

<p>WaterSense, a partnership program sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), seeks to protect the future of the nation’s water supply by offering Americans a simple way to use less water with water-efficient products, homes, and services. WaterSense labeled products, which are independently certified to use at least 20% less water and perform as well or better than standard models, have been on the market since 2007. As of 2021 there are more than 30,000 labeled models, including products used in residential and commercial bathrooms, and outdoor irrigation. EPA’s WaterSense program has also certified over 3,000 homes with WaterSense labeled fixtures and water-efficient features. By 2020 it had saved 5.3 trillion gallons of water and 603 billion kWh of electricity.

<p>A Randomized Controlled Trial tested the impacts of providing consumers, on their monthly utility bills, with high-resolution infrared images of their houses, information about their heat loss relative to their neighbors, and estimated savings from improving their home’s insulation and air tightness. This treatment was twice as effective as a traditional Home Energy Report (HER) treatment. This demonstrates the power of visual cues that help make the intangible more vivid, concrete, and actionable. This case study also illustrates how norm appeals can backfire when descriptive norms are provided to those who are already doing “better” than most, without also providing an affirming injunctive norm.

<p>To reduce energy demand, norm interventions may be more effective for shifting behaviors, and information interventions may be more effective for promoting the avoidance of targeted behaviors. Based on a review of 584 empirical papers.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/340">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>This study found appliance-specific feedback to be a powerful tool to curb electricity consumption. While the largest reductions in consumption occurred when social comparisons were made with identifiable neighbors, a comparison with the average user is likely the most practical in most situations. The interventions were especially effective when targeted at high baseline users.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/347">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>This second-order meta-analysis found that the studied interventions increased associated environmental behaviors by 2% to 12%. Social comparisons and financial approaches, followed closely by appeals and commitment strategies, were the most effective interventions while education and feedback were the least effective.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/334">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>Hard-to-decarbonize houses are properties that require difficult or expensive retrofits in order to make them green and sustainable. They are thought to represent one-quarter of homes globally, and to be responsible for more than one-quarter of all housing-related carbon emissions. A model was developed to identify homes that are hard to carbonize. If the model identifies a home as being hard to decarbonize, there is an 89% probability that it really is.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/372">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>Behavioral energy efficiency programs can reduce the same amount of damages from carbon emissions as structural retrofit programs, but in less time and at lower cost. They can  also further boost savings from structural programs.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/265">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>Many climate-relevant behaviours are habitual rather than intentional. Since changing contexts  can effectively break habits, interventions may be more effective when habits are disrupted - for example, when people have recently relocated, and through the use of incentives, nudges and competitions. Linking behavior to identity and a stable context, can create durable habits.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/320">Read More »</a></strong>
