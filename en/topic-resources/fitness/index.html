<h6>Virtually Everyone Benefits From More Physical Activity</h6>
Systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses (based largely on epidemiological studies consisting of large cohorts) have demonstrated a dose-response relationship between physical activity and premature mortality and the primary and secondary prevention of several chronic medical conditions. The relationships between physical activity and health outcomes are generally curvilinear such that marked health benefits are observed with relatively minor volumes of physical activity.  <a href="https://healthevidence.org/view-article.aspx?a=health-benefits-physical-activity-systematic-review-current-systematic-reviews-32750&amp;utm_source=New+at+Health+Evidence%E2%84%A2%3A+November+2017&amp;utm_campaign=1302bff514-EN+EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_11_13&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_7452659d88-1302bff514-198528393" target="_blank">More </a></div>

<p>Fairfax County established Transportation Demand Management (TDM) requirements (“proffers”) for new development that would have significant traffic impacts. For buildings within the urban centre of Tysons, trips had to be reduced between 25% and 65% during peak hours, depending on the size of the building and its proximity to the Metrorail stations. The county proffers required large new properties to annually monitor trips, conduct tenant commuting surveys, and show that they were meeting their trip reduction goals. They also had to conduct surveys every three years. Over seven years, 13 such developments generated 63% fewer trips, which was 34% beyond their goals. For the office buildings, this was likely at least partly a result of more people working from home during the COVID pandemic.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/766">Read More »</a></strong>

<p><em>Smart Trips Austin </em>encourages residents of Austin Texas, USA to take multi-modal transportation options (walk, bike, ride transit, and share rides) more often, rather than drive alone. The program focuses on personal interactions — educating individuals on their options and overcoming barriers to multi-modal travel. <em>Smart Trips </em>reinforces this new information using community-based programs such as learn-to-ride classes, transit instruction, and group walking activities. Initially, the program targeted residential neighbourhoods of Austin Texas; each year a different area was targeted. In 2020 the program expanded to city-wide and began to segment using a Stages of Change approach.  In 2021, it started targeting residents who had recently moved to or around Austin. <em>Smart Trips Austin</em> averaged a participation rate of 5-10% of households contacted, a 5-10% reduction in drive-alone trips among participants (about 41,000 vehicle trips per year), and a corresponding 5-10% increase in active and shared trips. This account of the program was designated a <em>Landmark</em> case study in 2023, making the City of Austin one of the few governments with more than one program designation. </p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/754">Read More »</a></strong>

The app informs users about local food nearing its best before date, often discounted by 50% or more. While some items may only be usable for a day or two, others can last for weeks – especially if frozen or cooked. The Flashfood app enables food stores to sell food that would otherwise be thrown out, while reducing their carbon footprint.  Consumers are able buy food that they would otherwise deem too expensive.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/763">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>What makes a great cycling city?  How did the medium-sized City of Copenhagen get its citizens to cycle to work / school 49% of the time? While topography and climate are significant influencers, safety, supportive infrastructure, and promotion also played key roles. Copenhagen increased cycling by making it safer, easier, and more convenient. This case illustrates the power of piloting alternative enhancements on an ongoing basis to further reduce barriers and increase benefits, based on regular surveys, traffic data and safety data. It also features a transparent planning process - the Bicycle Account – a research, evaluation, promotion, and citizen engagement tool used every two years since 1996.

<p>Paris is an inspiration for large cities around the world, having reduced car traffic in its core (Ile de France) from a mode share of 12.8% in 2010 to 6% in 2020.  How did Paris get to be one of the cities in the world with the lowest mode share for single occupant vehicles? The city is comparatively dense and has one of the top subways in the world. But what is most striking about its transformation is the increase in cycling and walking during this period – they increased from 55.4% in 2010 to 68% in 2020. Numerous programs offered by three levels of government explicitly prioritized bicycles over cars and reduced on-street car parking to make room for bike lanes. They taxed and restricted more polluting vehicles, and gradually phased them out, while providing a conversion bonus for the purchase or lease of electric-assisted bicycles and cargo bikes. In addition, car ads had to include messages promoting greener methods of transportation, and incentives were provided for bike repairs and tune-ups.

<p>About 75% of food waste goes to landfill, where it becomes one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions at 10% of total emissions. Too Good to Go turns food waste into a win-win situation for everyone, by creating jobs, generating revenue, reducing food waste, and diminishing environmental impacts. At its most basic, the app is a marketplace for surplus food. It enables you to see what extra food is likely to be available that day from nearby bakeries, stores, and restaurants - fresh food that would otherwise be thrown out at the end of the day because it would no longer be considered fresh and salable. Using the app, you can buy a ‘magic bag’ meal for roughly one third of what you would normally pay, then pick it up at the vendor’s closing time. As of June 2022, a total of 141 million bags had been sold, eliminating 775 million lb. (about 387,500 US tons) of CO2 emissions. In the first six months of 2022 alone, 88.5 million bags were sold, eliminating the equivalent of 973.5 million pounds (about 486,800 US tons) of CO2 emissions per year. </p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/758">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>A 30% discount in price led to significantly increased consumption of both vegetables and diet soda. A 15% discount group showed a non-significant increase in consumption of diet soda and no change for vegetables. Diet soda intake was inversely correlated with regular soda intake for those who received the 30% discount on diet soda. There was no effect from discounts on fruit intake, and no significant differences in the clinical measures, including body weight, relative to the discounts.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/405">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>This research argues that regarding laundry habits, we should treat lower emissions as a beneficial by-product rather than the main objective. We should focus on behaviors that create a need to wash rather than those involved with washing clothes. In other words, promote using clothes more often between washes by desensitizing feelings of disgust.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/397">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>Effectively reducing climate change requires marked, global behavior change. However, it is unclear which strategies are most likely to motivate people to change their climate beliefs and behaviors.

<p>To tackle the problem of food waste in restaurants, a nudge intervention was developed to increase the use of "doggy bags" in a restaurant close to Milan, Italy. In the intervention the default was to automatically provide a doggy bag to customers who had uneaten food on their plates, unless they actively chose to opt out. The number of doggy bags more than doubled.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/394">Read More »</a></strong>
