<h6>Virtually Everyone Benefits From More Physical Activity</h6>
Systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses (based largely on epidemiological studies consisting of large cohorts) have demonstrated a dose-response relationship between physical activity and premature mortality and the primary and secondary prevention of several chronic medical conditions. The relationships between physical activity and health outcomes are generally curvilinear such that marked health benefits are observed with relatively minor volumes of physical activity.  <a href="https://healthevidence.org/view-article.aspx?a=health-benefits-physical-activity-systematic-review-current-systematic-reviews-32750&amp;utm_source=New+at+Health+Evidence%E2%84%A2%3A+November+2017&amp;utm_campaign=1302bff514-EN+EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_11_13&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_7452659d88-1302bff514-198528393" target="_blank">More </a></div>

The Home Energy Score<sup><span lang="EN-CA" style='font-size: 8pt; font-family: "Minion Pro", serif;'>TM</span></sup> was developed to provide homeowners, buyers and renters with credible and directly comparable details about a home’s energy consumption. The ultimate goal was for homeowners to implement energy efficiency renovations. During the six months between July and December 2023, 464 participating households carried out home upgrades that saved 840,974 kWh per year, or 1,812 kWh per home per year. They undertook energy efficiency upgrades eleven times as often as non-participating households, and they claimed an upgrade incentive twelve times as often. An increase in consumer knowledge about energy efficiency, provided through assessor interaction and scorecard information, was a leading factor in the increase in upgrades.

<p>Better Cotton has changed farming techniques (behaviors) that in turn, among other social benefits, decreased the amount of water used per hectare when cultivating cotton (climate change adaptation). In addition, in 2021 it set a target of also reducing greenhouse gas emissions per ton of Better Cotton produced by 50% from a 2017 baseline (climate change mitigation). Its primary focus is on fostering voluntary action by the commercial sector, not regulations for the commercial sector, nor consumer communications. A similar approach could be used to increase the sustainability (or other desired traits) of many different commodities that are grown, caught or mined, and then used to manufacture items for sale.

<p>To meet global greenhouse gas targets, we will need to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, not just slow down emissions. Carbon Cure was designed to promote a shift in specification and purchasing behaviors across the construction supply chain, to recapture a significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and help abate climate change. This case study focuses on how the company promoted the rapid adoption by concrete plants of a new type of concrete – one that in its manufacturing process, removes and permanently stores significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere. By 2021 it had enabled the capture of 142,046,000 lb. of CO2 over nine years, an average of 15,782,889 lb. / year.

<p>Chicago was the first U.S. city to require building owners to prominently post a building’s energy performance rating, and to share that that rating with potential buyers and/or renters. While the rating system was being introduced, ComEd and Peoples Gas ran extensive complementary incentive and rebate programs that enabled building owners and managers to make energy improvements at little to no cost. From 2017 to 2020, this program saved 7,293.6 million Btu (2.1 million kwh) per year.

<p>Portland’s Transportation Wallet is a demand management strategy that encourages people to drive less and try alternative travel modes, while reducing the use of single-occupant vehicles, the demand for on-street parking, and the burdens of transportation costs for people with low-incomes. Users see it as a package of valuable travel options at a deep discount, or at no cost when trading in a parking permit or meeting income criteria. The program reduced participants’ drive-alone rates to 10% in 2023, from 24% in 2021. It is funded by charging for choosing the ‘competition’ (i.e. making it more expensive to drive / park a car.)

<p>Several policies / incentives, in place over an extended period, have made Norwegians more likely to purchase electric vehicles (EVs) than people in any other country. These incentives have included: exemption from vehicle registration and high purchase taxes, reduced road tolls, free parking, and access to some bus lanes. A similar long-term approach could be adapted for other big-ticket purchasing behaviors where the impact justifies the expense – for example energy-efficient home / building retrofits and appliances. Norway's electric cars are close to zero-emission as 98% of its electricity came from hydropower.

<p>According to Second Harvest, almost 60% (35.5 million metric tonnes) of food produced in Canada is wasted annually. Roughly 32% (1.2 million tonnes) is still edible. This app informs users about local food in surplus or nearing its best before date,  discounted by 50% or more. While some items should be consumed within a day or two, others can last for weeks – especially if frozen or cooked. The Flashfood app enables food stores to sell food that would otherwise be thrown out, while reducing their carbon footprint.  Consumers are able buy food that they would otherwise deem too expensive.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/763">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>This campaign focused on hot water heaters that provide water on demand for heating a home and also for cooking and cleaning. Lowering the water flow temperature from 80°C to 60°C could save a 9% reduction in total gas use, but only one in ten households had adjusted their water flow temperature in the previous year. Nesta developed and pilot tested an online tool to help occupants lower their own water flow temperatures. </p>
<p>In 2022 and 2023, over 214,000 people used the online tool and indicated that they had turned down their water flow temperatures. Based on Nesta’s research, that would save around 200,304,000 kWh and £20 million on energy bills and would avoid the release of 37,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.

<p>Fairfax County established Transportation Demand Management (TDM) requirements (“proffers”) for new development that would have significant traffic impacts. For buildings within the urban centre of Tysons, trips had to be reduced between 25% and 65% during peak hours, depending on the size of the building and its proximity to the Metrorail stations. The county proffers required large new properties to annually monitor trips, conduct tenant commuting surveys, and show that they were meeting their trip reduction goals. They also had to conduct surveys every three years. Over seven years, 13 such developments generated 63% fewer trips, which was 34% beyond their goals. For the office buildings, this was likely at least partly a result of more people working from home during the COVID pandemic.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/766">Read More »</a></strong>

<p><em>Smart Trips Austin </em>encourages residents of Austin Texas, USA to take multi-modal transportation options (walk, bike, ride transit, and share rides) more often, rather than drive alone. The program focuses on personal interactions — educating individuals on their options and overcoming barriers to multi-modal travel. <em>Smart Trips </em>reinforces this new information using community-based programs such as learn-to-ride classes, transit instruction, and group walking activities. Initially, the program targeted residential neighbourhoods of Austin Texas; each year a different area was targeted. In 2020 the program expanded to city-wide and began to segment using a Stages of Change approach.  In 2021, it started targeting residents who had recently moved to or around Austin. <em>Smart Trips Austin</em> averaged a participation rate of 5-10% of households contacted, a 5-10% reduction in drive-alone trips among participants (about 41,000 vehicle trips per year), and a corresponding 5-10% increase in active and shared trips. This account of the program was designated a <em>Landmark</em> case study in 2023, making the City of Austin one of the few governments with more than one program designation. </p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/754">Read More »</a></strong>
