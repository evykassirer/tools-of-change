<p>Around the world, professionals are working to reshape transportation systems and make them more sustainable. Technologies such as more efficient cars and cleaner fuels can help, but the reality is that we need to focus on changing individual behaviour in two key ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>increasing the use of non-driving travel modes like walking, cycling, public transit, carpooling and teleworking; and</li>
<li>making individuals' car use more efficient including their decisions about what car to buy, when and where to drive their car, and how to operate and maintain it.  <a href="../../../en/programs/transportation-professionals/">More</a> </li>

<p>Portland’s Transportation Wallet is a demand management strategy that encourages people to drive less and try alternative travel modes, while reducing the use of single-occupant vehicles, the demand for on-street parking, and the burdens of transportation costs for people with low-incomes. Users see it as a package of valuable travel options at a deep discount, or at no cost when trading in a parking permit or meeting income criteria. The program reduced participants’ drive-alone rates to 10% in 2023, from 24% in 2021. It is funded by charging for choosing the ‘competition’ (i.e. making it more expensive to drive / park a car.) Designated a <em>Landmark</em> case study by our transportation panel in 2024.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/770">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>Several policies / incentives, in place over an extended period, have made Norwegians more likely to purchase electric vehicles (EVs) than people in any other country. These incentives have included: exemption from vehicle registration and high purchase taxes, reduced road tolls, free parking, and access to some bus lanes. A similar long-term approach could be adapted for other big-ticket purchasing behaviors where the impact justifies the expense – for example energy-efficient home / building retrofits and appliances. Norway's electric cars are close to zero-emission as 98% of its electricity came from hydropower.

<p>Fairfax County established Transportation Demand Management (TDM) requirements (“proffers”) for new development that would have significant traffic impacts. For buildings within the urban centre of Tysons, trips had to be reduced between 25% and 65% during peak hours, depending on the size of the building and its proximity to the Metrorail stations. The county proffers required large new properties to annually monitor trips, conduct tenant commuting surveys, and show that they were meeting their trip reduction goals. They also had to conduct surveys every three years. Over seven years, 13 such developments generated 63% fewer trips, which was 34% beyond their goals. For the office buildings, this was likely at least partly a result of more people working from home during the COVID pandemic.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/766">Read More »</a></strong>

<p><em>Smart Trips Austin </em>encourages residents of Austin Texas, USA to take multi-modal transportation options (walk, bike, ride transit, and share rides) more often, rather than drive alone. The program focuses on personal interactions — educating individuals on their options and overcoming barriers to multi-modal travel. <em>Smart Trips </em>reinforces this new information using community-based programs such as learn-to-ride classes, transit instruction, and group walking activities. Initially, the program targeted residential neighbourhoods of Austin Texas; each year a different area was targeted. In 2020 the program expanded to city-wide and began to segment using a Stages of Change approach.  In 2021, it started targeting residents who had recently moved to or around Austin. <em>Smart Trips Austin</em> averaged a participation rate of 5-10% of households contacted, a 5-10% reduction in drive-alone trips among participants (about 41,000 vehicle trips per year), and a corresponding 5-10% increase in active and shared trips. This account of the program was designated a <em>Landmark</em> case study in 2023, making the City of Austin one of the few governments with more than one program designation. </p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/754">Read More »</a></strong>

<p><em>Liftshare </em>is a social enterprise that has worked with over 700 of the UK’s largest employers to reduce the number of single occupancy vehicle trips using carsharing, active transportation and public transit when commuting for work. With an online community of over 1 million members, it is estimated that Liftshare members have avoided the release of 300 million kg / 300,000 tonnes of commuter carbon emissions (averaging 50 million kg / 50,000 tonnes per year). In 2020, Liftshare launched Mobilityways, a sister platform that enables employers to evidence, track, plan and change their commuter emissions via a set of tools / modules that work seamlessly together.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/760">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>What makes a great cycling city?  How did the medium-sized City of Copenhagen get its citizens to cycle to work / school 49% of the time? While topography and climate are significant influencers, safety, supportive infrastructure, and promotion also played key roles. Copenhagen increased cycling by making it safer, easier, and more convenient. This case illustrates the power of piloting alternative enhancements on an ongoing basis to further reduce barriers and increase benefits, based on regular surveys, traffic data and safety data. It also features a transparent planning process - the Bicycle Account – a research, evaluation, promotion, and citizen engagement tool used every two years since 1996.

<p>Paris is an inspiration for large cities around the world, having reduced car traffic in its core (Ile de France) from a mode share of 12.8% in 2010 to 6% in 2020.  How did Paris get to be one of the cities in the world with the lowest mode share for single occupant vehicles? The city is comparatively dense and has one of the top subways in the world. But what is most striking about its transformation is the increase in cycling and walking during this period – they increased from 55.4% in 2010 to 68% in 2020. Numerous programs offered by three levels of government explicitly prioritized bicycles over cars and reduced on-street car parking to make room for bike lanes. They taxed and restricted more polluting vehicles, and gradually phased them out, while providing a conversion bonus for the purchase or lease of electric-assisted bicycles and cargo bikes. In addition, car ads had to include messages promoting greener methods of transportation, and incentives were provided for bike repairs and tune-ups.

<p>Seattle Children’s Hospital has operated a widely recognized trip reduction program since 1995. This program is an early and successful example of providing drivers with cash incentives to offset losing free parking (“parking cash out”). It is also one of the few ongoing examples of a program that pays people if they take a non-SOV way to work. Between 1995 and 2017, the percentage of employees who drive to work alone dropped from 73% to 33%. Further, the program’s commuting perks have helped attract &amp; retain quality employees, and the program has enabled the hospital to avoid spending $20 million to build new parking facilities.

<p>The City of Austin reduced employee commute travel by one million vehicle miles within six months of making its Leave Time Reward (LTR) a permanent incentive. During this period, the percentage of drive-alone trips fell from 53% to 41%. Attribution of these impacts to the City’s time off incentive policy is strengthened because that policy was introduced in the pilot study, then withdrawn after the pilot, then later reintroduced for the permanent program (Reversal Design.)

<p>Driver training for older people significantly reduces their number of motor vehicle crashes per person-year and improves their driving skills. On-road training is more efficacious than off-road training. Driving interventions of at least 3 hours taking place in 3 sessions over a period of 3 weeks may be required to improve driving skills in older drivers.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/423">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>As global warming continues, ambient temperatures will pose an increasingly critical barrier in more and more areas to choosing walking, cycling and other active transportation modes. Accordingly, it will be important to develop and promote routes and portions of routes that will be comfortable for walking and/or cycling in hot weather.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/335">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>Both short-term and long-term studies show that upon starting exercise training, many people decrease their non-exercise physical activity in compensation. This can reduce intended outcomes related to active living, heart health, physical activity, sustainable transportation (walking and cycling), and weight loss.

<p>This open-access articles in Behavioral Science &amp; Policy (7:2), found that "employees who were given transportation benefits by their employers were 9 times more likely to use transit rather than driving alone. Employees with bike-related benefits were 50 times more likely to commute by bike compared with employees with non-bike related benefits." Parking benefits were inversely related to employees' willingness to commute by transit, bike, or walking.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/324">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>Many climate-relevant behaviours are habitual rather than intentional. Since changing contexts  can effectively break habits, interventions may be more effective when habits are disrupted - for example, when people have recently relocated, and through the use of incentives, nudges and competitions. Linking behavior to identity and a stable context, can create durable habits.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/320">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>Since this 2017 report, bicycle-sharing schemes (BSSs) have been experiencing a major breakthrough in cities at a global scale. Of the estimated 1,600 schemes in operation in 2017, approximately 95 percent were launched since 2007, with more than 200 in 2017 alone. Recent technological transformations and innovations are dramatically reshaping our cities and increasing their options to introduce and manage bike-sharing services as a new mode of transport. The rapid evolution of technological advancements in BSSs, such as dockless bike-sharing schemes, electric bicycles, and increased private sector involvement, are prompting cities to ensure that legislation and regulations are in place to adequately safeguard the efficiency and safety of this mobility option.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/178">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>This field experiment with 7,680 low-income homeowners boosted referral rates, new participant numbers, and progam cost-effectiveness. It achieved this with two changes to a program that was already running. (1) It offered, in addition to the program's standard financial incentive, a non-contingent token gift upfront with a reminder about the programme, to evoke a sense of reciprocity. (2) It simplified the referral process by providing a mailable referral slip with a stamped return envelope.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/348">Read More »</a></strong>
