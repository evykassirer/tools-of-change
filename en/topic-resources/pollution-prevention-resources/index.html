During the past year, we've designated two new <em>Landmark </em>case studies involving pollution prevention, and added one new Topic Resource.<a href="../../../en/landmark/" target="_blank"> <em>Landmark </em></a>designation recognizes behavior change approaches and programs considered to be among the most successful, innovative, replicable and adaptable in the world. <em>Better Cotton</em> reduces greenhouse gas emissions and promotes less toxic pest management; it is a new case study and it is still being finalized. <em><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/729">Norway's Promotion of Electric Vehicles</a></em> describes how Norway became the world leader in electric vehicle adoption. In addition, we posted three other new climate change case studies  in 2024. <em><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/768">Cool Block</a></em> helps households, neighborhoods and entire cities become more sustainable. <a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/769">Google Maps </a>helps drivers lower their greenhouse gas emissions through their route choices. <a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/766">Proffers for New Development</a> requires new developments in Fairfax County, Virginia to promote and monitor trip reductions to couneract the impacts of adding more people. You can find these case studies (except Better Cotton) in the left-hand column below. The new Topic Resource is summarized at the top of the right hand column below. It argues that disgust sensitivity is a key barrier to changing laundering habits to reduce the environmental impacts of laundering. Accordingly, rather than focusing on environmental impacts, programs should work to extend the use frequency of clothes between washes by desensitizing feelings of disgust.</div>

<p>Better Cotton has changed farming techniques (behaviors) that in turn, among other social benefits, decreased the amount of water used per hectare when cultivating cotton (climate change adaptation). In addition, in 2021 it set a target of also reducing greenhouse gas emissions per ton of Better Cotton produced by 50% from a 2017 baseline (climate change mitigation). Its primary focus is on fostering voluntary action by the commercial sector, not regulations for the commercial sector, nor consumer communications. A similar approach could be used to increase the sustainability (or other desired traits) of many different commodities that are grown, caught or mined, and then used to manufacture items for sale.

<p>Portland’s Transportation Wallet is a demand management strategy that encourages people to drive less and try alternative travel modes, while reducing the use of single-occupant vehicles, the demand for on-street parking, and the burdens of transportation costs for people with low-incomes. Users see it as a package of valuable travel options at a deep discount, or at no cost when trading in a parking permit or meeting income criteria. The program reduced participants’ drive-alone rates to 10% in 2023, from 24% in 2021. It is funded by charging for choosing the ‘competition’ (i.e. making it more expensive to drive / park a car.)

<p>Several policies / incentives, in place over an extended period, have made Norwegians more likely to purchase electric vehicles (EVs) than people in any other country. These incentives have included: exemption from vehicle registration and high purchase taxes, reduced road tolls, free parking, and access to some bus lanes. A similar long-term approach could be adapted for other big-ticket purchasing behaviors where the impact justifies the expense – for example energy-efficient home / building retrofits and appliances. Norway's electric cars are close to zero-emission as 98% of its electricity came from hydropower.

<p>Fairfax County established Transportation Demand Management (TDM) requirements (“proffers”) for new development that would have significant traffic impacts. For buildings within the urban centre of Tysons, trips had to be reduced between 25% and 65% during peak hours, depending on the size of the building and its proximity to the Metrorail stations. The county proffers required large new properties to annually monitor trips, conduct tenant commuting surveys, and show that they were meeting their trip reduction goals. They also had to conduct surveys every three years. Over seven years, 13 such developments generated 63% fewer trips, which was 34% beyond their goals. For the office buildings, this was likely at least partly a result of more people working from home during the COVID pandemic.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/766">Read More »</a></strong>

With an online community of over 1 million members, it is estimated that Liftshare members have avoided the release of 300 million kg / 300,000 tonnes of commuter carbon emissions (averaging 50 million kg / 50,000 tonnes per year). In 2020, Liftshare launched Mobilityways, a sister platform that enables employers to evidence, track, plan and change their commuter emissions via a set of tools / modules that work seamlessly together.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/760">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>What makes a great cycling city?  How did the medium-sized City of Copenhagen get its citizens to cycle to work / school 49% of the time? While topography and climate are significant influencers, safety, supportive infrastructure, and promotion also played key roles. Copenhagen increased cycling by making it safer, easier, and more convenient. This case illustrates the power of piloting alternative enhancements on an ongoing basis to further reduce barriers and increase benefits, based on regular surveys, traffic data and safety data. It also features a transparent planning process - the Bicycle Account – a research, evaluation, promotion, and citizen engagement tool used every two years since 1996.

<p>Paris is an inspiration for large cities around the world, having reduced car traffic in its core (Ile de France) from a mode share of 12.8% in 2010 to 6% in 2020.  How did Paris get to be one of the cities in the world with the lowest mode share for single occupant vehicles? The city is comparatively dense and has one of the top subways in the world. But what is most striking about its transformation is the increase in cycling and walking during this period – they increased from 55.4% in 2010 to 68% in 2020. Numerous programs offered by three levels of government explicitly prioritized bicycles over cars and reduced on-street car parking to make room for bike lanes. They taxed and restricted more polluting vehicles, and gradually phased them out, while providing a conversion bonus for the purchase or lease of electric-assisted bicycles and cargo bikes. In addition, car ads had to include messages promoting greener methods of transportation, and incentives were provided for bike repairs and tune-ups.

<p>While many people in Germany say they would use green energy if presented with a choice, very few consumers do so. In contrast, most people have been using green energy in a few German municipalities where citizens have had to opt out for non-renewable energy supplies rather than having to opt-in to get renewable ones. This case study also illustrates the connection between green power choices and clean air / environmental health, and the value of randomized control trials (RCTs) for measuring program impacts.

<p>This field experiment with 7,680 low-income homeowners boosted referral rates, new participant numbers, and progam cost-effectiveness. It achieved this with two changes to a program that was already running. (1) It offered, in addition to the program's standard financial incentive, a non-contingent token gift upfront with a reminder about the programme, to evoke a sense of reciprocity. (2) It simplified the referral process by providing a mailable referral slip with a stamped return envelope.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/348">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>Two open-access articles in Behavioral Science &amp; Policy (7: 2) provide guidance on crafting messages to promote green behaviors. The first argues that interventions will be most effective if they not only make it easier for people to act (as behavioral science suggests) but also highlight moral reasons for taking action and assure people that their actions make a difference. The second outlines how to implement behavioral interventions that avoid crowding out support for deeper action. </p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/322">Read More »</a></strong>
