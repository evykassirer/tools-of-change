<h3>Latest News</h3>
<h6>January 15, 2025 |  Three New Case Studies and Four New Topic Resources</h6>
During the past year, we've added three new clean air case studies and one existing case study received <em>Landmark</em> designation. The new case studies, summarized at the top of the left hand column below, show how Google Maps helps drivers lower their greenhouse gas emissions through their route choices; how the Cool Block program promotes over one hundred actions that can help make households, neighborhoods and entire cities more sustainable; and how Fairfax County's requirements for new development reduce traffic impacts. Norways' Promotion of Electric Vehicles, originally posted in 2022, received <em>Landmark</em> designation this year. Landmark designation recognizes behavior change approaches and programs considered to be among the most successful, innovative, replicable and adaptable in the world. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, we posted four new clean air Topic Resources, summarized at the top of the right hand column below. They cover such topics as how to reduce car use in cities; how  disclosure requirements lower emissions, how behavioural and structural programs compare in reducing emissions, and how the Anger Activism model can help segment for people more likely to take action.</div>

<p>Portland’s Transportation Wallet is a demand management strategy that encourages people to drive less and try alternative travel modes, while reducing the use of single-occupant vehicles, the demand for on-street parking, and the burdens of transportation costs for people with low-incomes. Users see it as a package of valuable travel options at a deep discount, or at no cost when trading in a parking permit or meeting income criteria. The program reduced participants’ drive-alone rates to 10% in 2023, from 24% in 2021. It is funded by charging for choosing the ‘competition’ (i.e. making it more expensive to drive / park a car.)

<p>Several policies / incentives, in place over an extended period, have made Norwegians more likely to purchase electric vehicles (EVs) than people in any other country. These incentives have included: exemption from vehicle registration and high purchase taxes, reduced road tolls, free parking, and access to some bus lanes. A similar long-term approach could be adapted for other big-ticket purchasing behaviors where the impact justifies the expense – for example energy-efficient home / building retrofits and appliances. Norway's electric cars are close to zero-emission as 98% of its electricity came from hydropower.

<p>Fairfax County established Transportation Demand Management (TDM) requirements (“proffers”) for new development that would have significant traffic impacts. For buildings within the urban centre of Tysons, trips had to be reduced between 25% and 65% during peak hours, depending on the size of the building and its proximity to the Metrorail stations. The county proffers required large new properties to annually monitor trips, conduct tenant commuting surveys, and show that they were meeting their trip reduction goals. They also had to conduct surveys every three years. Over seven years, 13 such developments generated 63% fewer trips, which was 34% beyond their goals. For the office buildings, this was likely at least partly a result of more people working from home during the COVID pandemic.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/766">Read More »</a></strong>

<p><em>Smart Trips Austin </em>encourages residents of Austin Texas, USA to take multi-modal transportation options (walk, bike, ride transit, and share rides) more often, rather than drive alone. The program focuses on personal interactions — educating individuals on their options and overcoming barriers to multi-modal travel. <em>Smart Trips </em>reinforces this new information using community-based programs such as learn-to-ride classes, transit instruction, and group walking activities. Initially, the program targeted residential neighbourhoods of Austin Texas; each year a different area was targeted. In 2020 the program expanded to city-wide and began to segment using a Stages of Change approach.  In 2021, it started targeting residents who had recently moved to or around Austin. <em>Smart Trips Austin</em> averaged a participation rate of 5-10% of households contacted, a 5-10% reduction in drive-alone trips among participants (about 41,000 vehicle trips per year), and a corresponding 5-10% increase in active and shared trips. This account of the program was designated a <em>Landmark</em> case study in 2023, making the City of Austin one of the few governments with more than one program designation. </p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/754">Read More »</a></strong>

<p><em>Liftshare </em>is a social enterprise that has worked with over 700 of the UK’s largest employers to reduce the number of single occupancy vehicle trips using carsharing, active transportation and public transit when commuting for work. With an online community of over 1 million members, it is estimated that Liftshare members have avoided the release of 300 million kg / 300,000 tonnes of commuter carbon emissions (averaging 50 million kg / 50,000 tonnes per year). In 2020, Liftshare launched Mobilityways, a sister platform that enables employers to evidence, track, plan and change their commuter emissions via a set of tools / modules that work seamlessly together.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/case-studies/detail/760">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>What makes a great cycling city?  How did the medium-sized City of Copenhagen get its citizens to cycle to work / school 49% of the time? While topography and climate are significant influencers, safety, supportive infrastructure, and promotion also played key roles. Copenhagen increased cycling by making it safer, easier, and more convenient. This case illustrates the power of piloting alternative enhancements on an ongoing basis to further reduce barriers and increase benefits, based on regular surveys, traffic data and safety data. It also features a transparent planning process - the Bicycle Account – a research, evaluation, promotion, and citizen engagement tool used every two years since 1996.

<p>Paris is an inspiration for large cities around the world, having reduced car traffic in its core (Ile de France) from a mode share of 12.8% in 2010 to 6% in 2020.  How did Paris get to be one of the cities in the world with the lowest mode share for single occupant vehicles? The city is comparatively dense and has one of the top subways in the world. But what is most striking about its transformation is the increase in cycling and walking during this period – they increased from 55.4% in 2010 to 68% in 2020. Numerous programs offered by three levels of government explicitly prioritized bicycles over cars and reduced on-street car parking to make room for bike lanes. They taxed and restricted more polluting vehicles, and gradually phased them out, while providing a conversion bonus for the purchase or lease of electric-assisted bicycles and cargo bikes. In addition, car ads had to include messages promoting greener methods of transportation, and incentives were provided for bike repairs and tune-ups.

<p>While many people in Germany say they would use green energy if presented with a choice, very few consumers do so. In contrast, most people have been using green energy in a few German municipalities where citizens have had to opt out for non-renewable energy supplies rather than having to opt-in to get renewable ones. This case study also illustrates the connection between green power choices and clean air / environmental health, and the value of randomized control trials (RCTs) for measuring program impacts.

They can  also further boost savings from structural programs.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/265">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>When large power plants were required to disclose their carbon dioxide output, emissions fell by more than 7%, while at some small plants, exempt from disclosure, emissions rose at least 25%. This illustrates the Hawthorne Effect and the power of Norm Appeals.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/133">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>This open-access research article summarizes a Swiss panel study that found that car shedding (giving away a vehicle so that the household no longer has its own car) can have a positive effect on feelings of joy up to three years after the event, if not related to affordability. Affordability-driven car shedding, in contrast, was associated with decreased leisure satisfaction and feelings of joy up to three years later. </p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/318">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>Two open-access articles in Behavioral Science &amp; Policy (7: 2) provide guidance on crafting messages to promote green behaviors. The first argues that interventions will be most effective if they not only make it easier for people to act (as behavioral science suggests) but also highlight moral reasons for taking action and assure people that their actions make a difference. The second outlines how to implement behavioral interventions that avoid crowding out support for deeper action. </p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/322">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>This resource record describes four resources for communicating Air Quality data. Two of these summarize what has been learned from past studies, including the key barrier of low self-eficacy, and provide best practice recommendations. The third argues that in order to overcome low self-efficacy, more personalized data and greater engagement with the data are required. The fourth provides an overview of open-access air pollution data platforms around the world, and their value.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/327">Read More »</a></strong>

<p>The authors studied two anti-idling campaigns in Salt Lake County, Utah to understand if reduced engine idling leads to behavioral change and subsequent reduction in traffic-related air pollution exposure of the related school. They found a 38% decrease in idling time following an anti-idling campaign and an 11% decrease in the number of vehicles idling at the school drop-off zones.</p> <strong><a href="../../../en/topic-resources/detail/328">Read More »</a></strong>
